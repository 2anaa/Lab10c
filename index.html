    <h1>My Flask Web Page</h1>
    
    <h2>Framework Installation</h2>
    <p>I installed the Flask framework by first ensuring that Python was installed on my system. 
    Then, I used the command <code>pip install Flask</code> to install Flask. 
    Flask is a lightweight web framework written in Python, which is easy to set up and use for simple web applications.</p>
    
    <h2>Building the Web Page</h2>
    <p>To create the web page, I set up a basic Flask application with a single route ('/') that renders an HTML page. 
    The HTML page was created in the <code>templates/index.html</code> file. I used Flask's <code>render_template</code> function to render the page.</p>

    <h2>Difficulties Encountered and Solutions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Initially, I faced an issue with setting up the Flask development server. The solution was to ensure I had installed Flask correctly by using the <code>pip show Flask</code> command to verify the installation.</li>
        <li>Another difficulty was the proper directory structure for Flask. I solved this by following the official Flask documentation to ensure the `app.py` file and the `templates/` directory were properly set up.</li>
        <li>I had issues with running Flask on certain operating systems due to missing dependencies. I resolved this by ensuring my Python and Flask installations were up-to-date and compatible with my system.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>That's how I set up this simple web page using Flask!</p>
